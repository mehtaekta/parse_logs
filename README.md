# Coffee Express Boilerplate
Coffee Express Boilerplate is a template that provides the base code for
creating a server with CoffeeScript and Express. This package also sets up
the pug (jade) view engine with some template views.

## Getting Started
To get started using Coffee Express Boilerplate, you will need to run the
following commands:

```
$ npm install -g coffee-script nodemon
$ git clone https://github.com/nerdenough/coffee-express-boilerplate.git
$ npm install
```

Once all the packages are installed, you can start the server by running `npm
start`. This will start the server listening on port `3000` unless specified
otherwise.
